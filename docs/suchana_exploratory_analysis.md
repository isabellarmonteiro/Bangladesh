## Suchana's impact on the Production of Nutrient-rich SIS

> Small Indigenous Species: A CGIAR-Led Revival
>
> Small indigenous species (SIS) are a naturally occurring dietary staple in Bangladesh. However, with the rise of commercial aquaculture, SIS populations declined significantly as farmers increasingly "cleaned" their ponds with pesticides. This practice, based on the belief that small, lower-yielding native fish competed with more marketable species like carp and tilapia, led to the widespread loss of SIS.
> 
> WorldFish has worked to dismantle this misconception, pioneering the promotion of carp-tilapia-SIS polyculture to enhance both productivity and nutrition. Since 2011, it has been implementing this approach through smaller projects like IDEA and ANEP. However, these initiatives remained limited in scale, each reaching fewer than 2,000 households across different divisions.


Suchana (2016-2023) was a large-scale project in the Sylhet division focusing on multiple nutrition interventions. it reached 250,000 households over 7 years, with at least 75,000 of these also getting the aquaculture-related interventions, which were delivered by WorldFish. 
The interventions included:
- Encouraging the production of SIS;
-  Encouraging the production of dried fish;
-  Disseminating carp-tilapia-SIS polyculture systems;
-  Encouraging the usage of improved management practices
