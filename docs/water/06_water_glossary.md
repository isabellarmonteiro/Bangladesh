<b>WATER RESOURCES:</b> <br> <br>
<b>River Basin</b>: An area of land in which all excess water will be drained by the same main river or any its affluents (smaller water streams that flow into the main one). <br>

<br><br><br>


<b>IRRIGATION:</b> <br> <br>
<b>Command Area</b>: All land under being irrigated under the same irrigation system and from a same source.  <br>

<b>Minor Irrigation</b>: An irrigation project with Command Area smaller than 2,000 hectares. In Bangladesh, the most relevant minor irrigation technologies are: Deep Tubewell,  Shallow Tubewell, and Low Lift Pumps.  <br>

<b>Deep Tubewell</b>: a groundwater irrigation technology that accesses water from deep aquifers, thus allowing arsenic contamination levels to be much lower when compared to shallow tubewells (Cocciolo, 2020). This irrigation method covers 19.26% of the irrigated area in Bangladesh, with 97% of the area under DTW being powered by Electricity (BADC, 2020).<br>

<b>Shallow Tubewell</b>: a groundwater irrigation technology that accesses water at a depth of usually less than 15 meters. This irrigation method covers 53.59% of the irrigated area in Bangladesh, and 65% of this area is powered by Diesel (BADC, 2020). <br>

<b>Low Lift Pump</b>: a surface water irrigation technology that covers 22.35% of the irrigated area in Bangladesh, 80% of this area being powered by Diesel (BADC, 2020). <br>

<b>WATER-RELATED RISKS:</b> <br> <br>

<b>Polders</b>: Polders are areas of land below that have been reclaimed from bodies of water. In spite of being below the sea level, these areas are not flooded because water has been drained out from them. Their construction involves the enclosure of an initially flooded area through the construction of dikes. Water levels inside the Polder are then regulated according to the needs of those using the area. Advantages of Polder construction include the creation of new land for agricultural activities, the protection from tidal floods and salinity intrusion.  <br>

<b>Sluice Gate</b>: Gates that can be opened or closed to regulate the quantity of water inside the Polder. <br>

<b>Tidal Floods</b>: When low-lying coastal areas are flooded during exceptionally high tide events. <br>

<b>Salinity Intrusion</b>: When freshwater aquifers in coastal areas become saline. This causes agricultural losses, and degrades sources of drinking water. <br>
