# CGIAR Engagement Relating to Water Systems
Water Systems play an important role for all five impact areas that the CGIAR focuses on. Indeed, improving the availability and the quality of water sources can have positive impacts on nutrition, health and food security by increasing agricultural yields through irrigation, and improving sanitation and hygiene. Similarly, new irrigation technologies can boost income and allow farmers to save valuable time. 

Additionally, the conservation and appropriate management of water resources is essential for biodiversity, for mitigating environmental degradation, and for the adaptation to climate-related risks. Without an inclusive and participatory approach to finding these systems-level solutions, minority groups are likely to incur higher losses from climate change.

Due to its cross-cutting significance for many of its work streams, the CGIAR's approach to this topic has heavily relied on multi-center collaboration. Through the years, many shared initiatives have helped put Water Systems at the forefront of technical and policy-oriented discussions in Bangladesh, with IWMI, IRRI and WorldFish playing important roles for their execution.

## Main CGIAR Priorities
### Current
One of the key objectives of current CGIAR activities that are focused on Water Systems is to enhance food security while simultaneously conserving ecosystems. To accomplish this goal, IWMI (International Water Management Institute) is invested in expanding the inclusive access to solar-based irrigation systems, and to tools that monitor how much water can sustainably be extracted from a given ecosystem (IWMI, 2022).

Improving resilience to climate change and water-related risks is a second goal for Water Systems. For this reason, intensive investment in early warning systems for floods and droughts, as well as in the equitable expansion of index-based weather insurance have been carried out (IWMI, 2022).

Economic and social inclusion, along with gender equality, is the third major goal for this research portfolio due to its importance for achieving poverty reduction and resiliance. As a result, these topics have been streamlined into all Water System initiatives (IWMI, 2022). In order to reach these three main goals, digital tools are being leveraged to improve water management and decision-making processes. These tools enable efficient data collection, analysis, and dissemination, facilitating evidence-based policies and interventions.


### Building Blocks



From the beginning, the center’s priorities for Bangladesh reflected the need to increase the yields of rice-based systems, due to population growth. A second priority, given the disparities in land tenure, was to develop new approaches to groundwater utilization that would benefit small-scale and landless farmers. For this purpose, shifting the ownership and management of water resources to farmers cooperatives, something the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) had already been advocating for, became a priority (AR 1988).

Because of the government’s emphasis on privatizing the installation of pumps and the management of the pump irrigation sector (AR 1991), in 1989, a committee composed of researchers and government representatives selected IWMI’s first study in the country to be on Privatization of Small-scale Irrigation (AR, 1989). 

## IWMI's Presence in Bangladesh

IWMI began working in Bangladesh in 1988. Although the center currently does not have staff permanently residing in Bangladesh,
