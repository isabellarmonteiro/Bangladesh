# CGIAR Engagement Relating to Water Systems
Water Systems play an important role for all five impact areas that the CGIAR focuses on. Indeed, improving the availability and the quality of water sources can have positive impacts on nutrition, health and food security by increasing agricultural yields through irrigation, and improving sanitation and hygiene. Similarly, new irrigation technologies can boost income and allow farmers to save valuable time. 

Due to its cross-cutting importance for various work streams, the CGIAR's approach to Water Systems has heavily relied on multi-center collaboration. In Bangladesh, an important role is played by the International Water Management Insitute to streamline the

### Building Blocks


## IWMI's Presence in Bangladesh
IWMI began working in Bangladesh in 1988. 

From the beginning, the center’s priorities for the country reflected the need to increase the yields of rice-based systems, due to population growth. A second priority, given the disparities in land tenure, was to develop new approaches to groundwater utilization that would benefit small-scale and landless farmers. For this purpose, shifting the ownership and management of water resources to farmers cooperatives, something the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) had already been advocating for, became a priority (AR 1988).

Because of the government’s emphasis on privatizing the installation of pumps and the management of the pump irrigation sector (AR 1991), in 1989, a committee composed of researchers and government representatives selected IWMI’s first study in the country to be on Privatization of Small-scale Irrigation (AR, 1989).
