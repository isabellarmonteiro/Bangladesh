## Climate Change

The CGIAR has consistently prioritized the management of climate-related risk as a significant area of research. This commitment is evident in the research priorities of individual centers as well as numerous Challenge/Research Programs. As a result, the organization has fostered the creation of innovative solutions that strive to both adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change. Examples of this work include crop and resource management technologies, as well as numerous genetically improved varieties that better suited to abiotic stress.
