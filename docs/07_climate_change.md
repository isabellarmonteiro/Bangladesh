## Climate Change
\\
The CGIAR has consistently prioritized the management of climate-related risk as a significant area of research. This commitment is evident in the cross-cutting research priorities of individual centers, which have long fostered the creation of innovative solutions that strive to both adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change. Examples of this work include crop and resource management technologies, as well as the creation of numerous genetically improved varieties that exhibit enhanced resilience to abiotic stressors.

Furthermore, with the establishment of multi-center initiatives in the past decades, it became possible to address the various aspects of climate-related risk through a comprehensive and synergistic approach. Notably, CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) marked a big turning point in that respect, through the creation of a coordinated research portfolio that aimed at finding context appropriate ways of scaling-up the centers' climate-smart innovations.

> The CCAFS lasted from 2011 to 2021, and it aimed at developing more resilient agricultural systems, encouraging low-emission agricultural development, and at developing Climate Information Services for decision-making (CGIAR-IEA, 2015). In South Asia, CCAFS activities were implemented in three countries: Bangladesh, Nepal and India (CGIAR-IEA, 2015).
