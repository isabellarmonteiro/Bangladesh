# Climate Change
## Overview
The CGIAR has consistently prioritized the management of climate-related risk as a significant area of research. This commitment is evident in the cross-cutting research priorities of individual centers, which have long fostered the creation of innovative solutions that strive to both adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change. Examples of this work include crop and resource management technologies, as well as the creation of numerous genetically improved varieties that exhibit enhanced resilience to abiotic stressors.

Furthermore, with the establishment of multi-center initiatives in the past decades, it became possible to address the various aspects of climate-related risk through a comprehensive and synergistic approach. Notably, CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) marked a big turning point in that respect, with the creation of a coordinated research portfolio that aimed at finding context appropriate ways of scaling-up the centers' climate-smart innovations.

> The CCAFS lasted from 2011 to 2021, and it aimed at developing more resilient agricultural systems, encouraging low-emission agricultural development, and at developing Climate Information Services for decision-making (CGIAR-IEA, 2015). In South Asia, CCAFS activities were implemented in three countries: Bangladesh, Nepal and India (CGIAR-IEA, 2015).

> During the initial year of the CRP, assessment studies were conducted to understand the magnitude of yield losses due to extreme climatic events, the gender differences in climate risk perception and management, and the site-specific potential of various mitigation practices (CCAFS, 2011). In order to make sure the proposed technologies would properly address climate-risk in the area and meet farmers' demands, participatory research approaches, such as Climate-Smart Villages and Farmer Field Schools, were deployed to identify innovations and test their feasibility.

> A third major focus of this Research Program was the provision of Climate Information Services, which included forecasts and early warnings, as well as of support to farmers' and policy-makers' decisions.

## Areas of Work

### Genetic Improvement

#### Rice
After an initial focus on producing varieties that offer higher yields and tolerance to biotic stressors, in the early 2000s IRRI's breeding efforts in Bangladesh shifted towards the development of tolerance to abiotic stress. The main three abiotic stresses, floods, soil salinity, and droughts, cover 50%, 30%, and 20% of the total arable land area in the country respectively (). Furthermore, the development of breed short-duration/early maturing rice varieties has been a major focus for IRRI researchers since the 90s, allowing to create varieties that are protected for late-season droughts, and suitable for diversification through the early planting of a second season crop ().

| Type of Modification      | Trait         | Varieties |
|:-------------|:------------------|:------|
| Abiotic Stress | Flood Tolerance | brri dhan 52; brri dhan 51, bina dhan 12; (bina dhan 11, bina dhan 23)  |
| Abiotic Stress | Salt Tolerance   | bina dhan 8, bina dhan 10, brri dhan 53, brri dhan 54, brri dhan 55, brri dhan 61 (bina dhan 23, brri dhan 47; brri dhan 67, brri dhan 73, brri dhan 78, brri dhan 40) |
| Abiotic Stress | Drought Tolerance | BRRI dhan 56--2011 (Aman), BRRI dhan 66--2014 (Aman), BRRI dhan 71--2014 (Aman)|
| Duration | Shorter Duration | varieties  |

#### Maize

#### Lentils
In the past decades, one of the main genetic improvement on lentils has been to develop varieties that are both early-maturing and suitable for late-planting. Shorter-duration varieties of
non-rice crops protects yields from droughts, and allows to grow of extra crop after early harvest. Additionally, combining this characteristcs with late planting makes it possible to cultivate them in rice-fallow areas, thus achieving intensification and diversifying sources of income.

| Abiotic Stress | Drought Tolerance | Binamasur 10 |
|  Duration | Shorter Duration  | BARI-Masur 9; Bari-Masur-5 |

#### Forecasts and Policy Support

Since 2014, the CCAFS South Asia (SA) Regional Scenarios Coordinator has been supporting the Government of Bangladesh (GoB) with successful policy guidance by using participatory scenarios for planning. Namely, CCAFS had supported the planning Commission, Government of Bangladesh in the inception and formulation of its 7th Five Year Plan (FYP). 

In a partnership with A4NH, CCAFS developed future scenarios for GHG emissions in Bangladesh that took into account a nutrition security perspective (). The forecasting tool was used to guide policy-making, and, in Bangladesh, the robustness of the 7th Five Year Plan was tested with respect to these different scenarios ().

Other forecasting tools were developed by CIMMYT and CCAFS while working under the Climate Services for Resilient Development (CSRD) partnership between 2016 and 2019. Namely, early warning and predictive tools were developed for droughts, and for the incidence of Wheat Blast and Stemphylium blight (). Furthermore, in 2019, CIMMYT started to work on Climate Services for Aquaculture, aiming to provide both forecasts, and tailored advice on culture fisheries in Bangladesh (). 

Support on climate-smart investments were also tailored to governments, as the creation of Country Profiles in conjunction with the World Bank led to the identification of investment opportunities through Climate-Smart Agriculture Investment Plans (CSAIP). In Bangladesh, the CSAIP was developed in parallel with the World Bankâ€™s decision to invest 500 million in the Livestock and Dairy Development Project ().
