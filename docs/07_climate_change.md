## Climate Change

The CGIAR has consistently prioritized the management of climate-related risk as a significant area of research. This commitment is evident in the research priorities of individual centers as well as numerous Challenge/Research Programs. As a result, the organization has fostered the creation of innovative solutions that strive to both adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change.
