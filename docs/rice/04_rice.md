# Rice

## Significance

Rice is the main staple food in Bangladesh, providing 70% of the daily caloric intake for the average Bengali (Mottaleb and Mishra, 2016). It also holds significant importance for the country’s Economy, with nearly half of rural employment depending on this crop and with rice contributing to half of Bangladesh’s agricultural GDP (BBS, 2018).

## Overview of the Sector
In Bangladesh, rice falls under the category of “Notified crops”, which leads to increased restrictions for the conduction of breeding activities, with private firms being generally prohibited from doing so. For rice, this means that the vast majority of Modern varieties are introduced by public agencies, while most Hybrid varieties are released by private actors, mainly the NGO BRAC (Naher and Spielman, 2021).

The country has three main rice seasons: Boro (irrigated, December–May), Aus (March–August), and Aman (rain-fed, June–November). Boro is the dominant season for rice production, made feasible by modern technologies like tube well irrigation and short-duration varieties. Aman is the second most significant season in terms of production area, though it is generally less productive than Boro. 

Overall, the area used for rice production in Bangladesh has remained stable over the past 50 years, consistently covering about 75% of agricultural land (IRRI). However, total rice production has nearly quadrupled during this time, primarily due to the adoption of modern varieties (BBS, 2018). This remarkable increase in productivity has enabled Bangladesh to avert food shortages like the severe crisis in 1974.

Despite these gains, the country remains a net importer of rice (GOB, 2023). Furthermore, the recent slowdown in productivity improvements during the Boro season indicates that achieving self-sufficiency will be challenging unless significant productivity enhancements occur in the Aman and Aus seasons.

### Adoption of Modern Varieties 

Because the Boro season is only feasible with the usage of modern early maturing varieties, 100% of the farmers are using either a modern variety or a hybrid one. For aman, over 70% of farmers were using modern varieties (Naher and Spielman, 2021).
On the other hand, hybrid rice has not yet gained significant traction. Several factors explain this slow adoption. Unlike modern inbred varieties, farmers must purchase hybrid seeds every season, which are approximately four times more expensive than other rice seeds. Furthermore, the yield gains from hybrid rice in Bangladesh are not substantially higher than those from elite inbred varieties like BRRI dhan29 (CIMMYT, 2021).

Although modern rice varieties are widely adopted, there is still much reliance on older ones - in particular for Boro. Figures from the BIHS indicate that in 2018,  two varieties—BRRI dhan 28 and 29, both released in 1994— accounted for 61.6% of the cultivated rice plots during the Boro season.



### Main Constraints
Water and land availability are significant challenges for rice production in Bangladesh, making it nearly impossible to expand cultivation areas further.

> Main Constraints - Rice
> 
> - <b>Groundwater Scarcity</b>: In the Northwestern regions, limited groundwater availability restricts irrigation, particularly affecting Boro rice production.
> 
> - <b>Flooding</b>: In low-lying areas along major rivers, frequent flooding during the monsoon season causes substantial losses of Aman rice.
> 
> - <b>Saline Intrusion</b>: In the Southern Coastal districts, salinity intrusion during the dry season results in significant losses, particularly for Boro rice crops.
>
> - <b>Declining Land Availability</b>: Per capita availability of agricultural land is decreasing due to population growth and the conversion of farmland to industrial and urban uses.
