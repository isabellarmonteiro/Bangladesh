# CGIAR Engagement in Fisheries Sector

Fisheries and Aquaculture have long been areas of significant interest for the CGIAR. Initially, from 2012 to 2016, these subjects were encompassed within the Livestock and Fish CGIAR Research Program (CRP). However, in order to emphasize and prioritize research in this field, a distinct program called Fish Agri-Food Systems (FISH) was established and operated from 2017 to 2021. This program was jointly led by WorldFish and the International Water Management Institute (IWMI). <br>

In Bangladesh, WorldFish serves as the primary CGIAR center dedicated to Fisheries and Aquaculture. Additionally, two Research Initiatives in the country are directly related to Fish: the Aquatic Foods and the One Health Research Initiatives.
