# CGIAR Engagement in Fisheries Sector
<br>

Fisheries and Aquaculture have long been areas of significant interest for the CGIAR, with a history of many multi-center initiatives being focused on this topic. In 2003, the Challenge Program on Water and Food was launched, encompassing Aquatic Ecosystems and Fisheries as one of its main thematic areas, for which WorldFish was the leading center. This program ran for 10 years, and it aimed at improving water productivity in six river Basins, including the Indo-Gangetic one. 

The CGIAR Research Program on Aquatic Agricultural Systems (AAS) was established from 2011 to 2016, emphasizing the importance of involving local stakeholders in research activities to ensure lasting results within the "Research in Development" framework (Douthwaite et al. 2015). 
Similarly, from 2012 to 2016, these subjects were encompassed within the Livestock and Fish CGIAR Research Program (CRP), which helped give increased attention to value-chain development. In order to further prioritize research in this field, a follow-up program called Fish Agri-Food Systems (FISH) was established and operated from 2017 to 2021, being jointly led by WorldFish and the International Water Management Institute (IWMI). <br>

In Bangladesh, WorldFish serves as the primary CGIAR center dedicated to Fisheries and Aquaculture. Additionally, two Research Initiatives in the country are directly related to Fish: the Aquatic Foods and the One Health Research Initiatives. 

## Main CGIAR Priorities
### Current
In recent years, the development and dissemination of genetically improved Carp, Tilapia and Small-Indigenous Species has been at the forefront of the CGIAR's activities. Additionally, regarding Crop Management Practices, WorldFish outlines the development of Rice-Fish Systems, which allows to intensify farming systems and diversify income sources, as a priority for Bangladesh. 

When it comes to Natural Resource Management, community-based fishery management approaches have been developed to tread the fine line between restoring native populations of fish and allowing vulnerable communities to maintain their traditional sources of livelihoods. Moreover, significant attention has been placed in guaranteeing that biosecurity and seed quality standards live up to those of international markets, with important contributions in the development of disease diagnostic and control measures for tilapia and shrimp.

### Past 

WorldFish's priorities for Bangladesh have evolved in conjunction with the country's conjectures. Nevertheless, a 2004 document detailing the center's achievements up to that point in time present remarkable similarities to current operational priorities. Indeed, early activities in Bangladesh included the dissemination of various rice-fish systems, the genetic enhancement of aquaculture species, and the conservation and management of both marine and inland fisheries, which hinged on characterizing the legal and insititutional constraints to conservation and on promoting the community-based management of inland waterbodies (WorldFish, 2004).  

The first multi-center initiatives drafted newly devised priorities for aquaculture in Bangladesh. Namely, the Challenge Program on Water and Food, gave further importance to developing rice-fish systems, of community-based fish culture ().

## WorldFish's Presence in Bangladesh
WorldFish has been actively engaged in Bangladesh since 1987 (WorldFish, 2004), forging strong partnerships with government entities and playing a pivotal role in policy formulation. Over the years, the center has also established an extensive network of local partners, encompassing private sector institutions, non-governmental organizations, and other local stakeholders operating at different levels. WorldFish has placed significant emphasis on enhancing the capacity of these collaborators, thus ensuring the long-term viability and sustainability of CGIAR-promoted initiatives within the country.
