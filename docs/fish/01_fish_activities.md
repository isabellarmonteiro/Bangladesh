# CGIAR Engagement in Fisheries Sector
<br>

Fisheries and Aquaculture have long been areas of significant interest for the CGIAR. Initially, from 2012 to 2016, these subjects were encompassed within the Livestock and Fish CGIAR Research Program (CRP). However, in order to emphasize and prioritize research in this field, a distinct program called Fish Agri-Food Systems (FISH) was established and operated from 2017 to 2021. This program was jointly led by WorldFish and the International Water Management Institute (IWMI). <br>

In Bangladesh, WorldFish serves as the primary CGIAR center dedicated to Fisheries and Aquaculture. Additionally, two Research Initiatives in the country are directly related to Fish: the Aquatic Foods and the One Health Research Initiatives.

## Main CGIAR Priorities
### Current
Currently, the development and dissemination of genetically improved carp species, tilapia and Small-Indigenous Species has been at the forefront of the CGIAR's activities. Additionally, regarding Crop Management Practices, WorldFish outlines the development of Rice-Fish Systems, which allow for intensification of production and diversification of livelihoods, as a priority for Bangladesh. 

When it comes to Natural Resource Management, community-based fishery management approaches have been developed to tread the fine line between restoring native populations of fish and allowing vulnerable communities to maintain their traditional sources of livelihoods. Moreover, significant attention has been placed in guaranteeing that biosecurity and seed quality standards live up to those of international markets, with important contributions in the development of disease diagnostic and control measures for tilapia and shrimp.
### Past 

## WorldFish's Presence in Bangladesh
WorldFish has been actively engaged in Bangladesh since 1989, forging strong partnerships with government entities and playing a pivotal role in policy formulation. Over the years, the center has also established an extensive network of local partners, encompassing private sector institutions, non-governmental organizations, and other local stakeholders operating at different levels. WorldFish has placed significant emphasis on enhancing the capacity of these collaborators, thus ensuring the long-term viability and sustainability of CGIAR-promoted initiatives within the country.
