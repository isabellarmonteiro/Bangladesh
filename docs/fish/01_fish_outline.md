# The Fisheries Sector in Bangladesh
## Significance
### Economic Significance

<br>
Fisheries, including shrimp and prawn production, are the second most valuable type of agricultural operations (Belton et al, 2011), and they are Bangladesh's most important primary export commodity (Dey et al., 2008a). <br>


Due to its economic importance, this sector is one of the main sources of livelihoods for people in Bangladesh. It is estimated that 1.2 million people in the country are directly employed in the fisheries sector. Further 12 million rural people indirectly receive income from fisheries-related activities (Dey et al., 2008a). Furthermore, Fisheries have long been regarded by the government as having the potential to increase employment in rural areas, both through self-employment and by creating a demand for hired labor.

### Nutritional and Cultural Significance

Fish is one of the most popular nutritient-rich foods in Bangladesh, accounting for 60% of the consumption of animal sourced products (Belton et al, 2011).

## Overview of the Sector

### Activities


#### Patterns 
Within the agricultural sector, the contribution of fisheries increased from 7% in the mid 1970s to a stable 22% between 2005 and 2021 ().
While the share of the GDP generated from agriculture is decreasing, as the contribution from industries increases, the fisheries sector maintained above average growth rates when compared to other agricultural activities (Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, 2022).
