In Bangladesh, an estimated 1.2 million people are directly employed in the fisheries sector. Further 12 million rural people indirectly earn livelihood from fisheries-related activities (Dey et al. 2008a). Fisheries, including shrimp and prawn, is the second most valuable agricultural crop (WorldFish, 2011 - â€œReview of Aquaculture & Fish Consumption in Bangladesh")
