# The Fisheries Sector in Bangladesh
## Significance
### Economic Significance

Fisheries play a vital role in Bangladesh's agricultural operations and economy. They are not only the second most valuable type of agricultural operations (Belton et al., 2011) but also the country's most significant primary export commodity (Dey et al., 2008a). <br> 

The fisheries sector holds immense importance in rural Bangladesh as it serves as a primary source of livelihoods. Direct employment in the fisheries sector is estimated to benefit around 1.2 million individuals in the country, while fisheries-related activities indirectly support approximately 12 million people in rural areas (Dey et al., 2008a). <br> 

In recent years, there has been a major focus on promoting the growth of the aquaculture industry and the commercial fishing sector. These sectors are believed to possess untapped potential to foster rural employment, as the development of family-owned and commercial operations is expected to stimulate self-employment and the demand for hired labor. Recognizing this opportunity, the government of Bangladesh has placed considerable efforts in the promotion and support of these industries (Karim et al, 2006). 

### Nutritional and Cultural Significance

Fish is one of the most popular nutritient-rich foods in Bangladesh. Indeed, it accounts for 60% of the consumption of animal sourced products (Belton et al, 2011), and is a crucial source of vitamins and micronutrients for the poor (Thilsted et al. 1997). The common saying "rice and fish makes a Bengali" appropriately highlights the importance of aquatic organisms for diets in Bangladesh. Nevertheless, with the decrease in the consumption of pulses (Dey et al., 2008a), another protein-rich staple, the dependency on fish intensified in the early 2000s (BBS 2003c and 2007b). <br>

Given the high reliance on fish to achieve the necessary macro and micronutrient intake, as well as the fact that its consumption is primarily sourced domestically (Dey et al., 2008), it is thus clear that the development of the fisheries sector is pivotal to guarantee Food Security in Bangladesh, amid a large increase in population that the country has experienced since the 1950s.

## Overview of the Sector

### Activities


#### Patterns 
Within the agricultural sector, the contribution of fisheries increased from 7% in the mid 1970s to a stable 22% between 2005 and 2021 ().
While the share of the GDP generated from agriculture is decreasing, as the contribution from industries increases, the fisheries sector maintained above average growth rates when compared to other agricultural activities (Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, 2022). 

### Constraints and Potential 
Because of its low-lying elevation, being less than five meters above sea level, the Coastal area of Bangladesh is prone to tidal surges and flooding during the rainy season, and to  salinity intrusion during the dry one (CPFW, 2014; Mondal et al., 2013).
