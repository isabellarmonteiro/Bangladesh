# The Fisheries Sector in Bangladesh
## Significance
### Economic Significance

<br>
In Bangladesh, it is estimated that 1.2 million people are directly employed in the fisheries sector. Further 12 million rural people indirectly earn livelihood from fisheries-related activities (Dey et al., 2008a). Overall, fisheries, including shrimp and prawn production, are the second most valuable type of agricultural operations (Belton et al, 2011), and they are Bangladesh's most important primary export commodity (Dey et al., 2008a). <br>

Within the agricultural sector, the contribution of fisheries increased from 7% in the mid 1970s to a stable 22% between 2005 and 2021 ().
While the share of the GDP generated from agriculture is decreasing, as the contribution from industries increases, the fisheries sector maintained above average growth rates when compared to other agricultural activities (Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, 2022).

### Nutritional and Cultural Significance

Fish is one of the most popular nutritient-rich foods in Bangladesh, accounting for 60% of the consumption of animal sourced products (Belton et al, 2011).
