# The Fisheries Sector in Bangladesh
## Significance
### Economic Significance

<br>
Fisheries play a vital role in Bangladesh's agricultural operations and economy. They are not only the second most valuable type of agricultural operations (Belton et al., 2011) but also the country's most significant primary export commodity (Dey et al., 2008a). <br> 

The fisheries sector holds immense importance in rural Bangladesh as it serves as a primary source of livelihoods. Direct employment in the fisheries sector is estimated to benefit around 1.2 million individuals in the country, while fisheries-related activities indirectly support approximately 12 million people in rural areas (Dey et al., 2008a). <br> 

In recent years, there has been a major focus on promoting the growth of the aquaculture industry and the commercial fishing sector. These sectors are believed to possess untapped potential to foster rural employment, as the development of family-owned and commercial operations is expected to stimulate self-employment and the demand for hired labor. Recognizing this opportunity, the government of Bangladesh has placed considerable efforts in the promotion and support of these industries (Karim et al, 2006). 

### Nutritional and Cultural Significance

Fish is one of the most popular nutritient-rich foods in Bangladesh, accounting for 60% of the consumption of animal sourced products (Belton et al, 2011).

## Overview of the Sector

### Activities


#### Patterns 
Within the agricultural sector, the contribution of fisheries increased from 7% in the mid 1970s to a stable 22% between 2005 and 2021 ().
While the share of the GDP generated from agriculture is decreasing, as the contribution from industries increases, the fisheries sector maintained above average growth rates when compared to other agricultural activities (Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, 2022).
