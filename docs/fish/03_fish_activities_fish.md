# CGIAR Contributions in Fisheries and Aquaculture
<br>

Fisheries and Aquaculture have long been areas of significant interest for the CGIAR, with a history of many multi-center initiatives being focused on this topic.
In Bangladesh, WorldFish serves as the primary CGIAR center dedicated to Fisheries and Aquaculture, actively engaged in the country since 1987 (WorldFish, 2004). Over the years, the center has forged strong partnerships with government entities and played a pivotal role in policy formulation. 
Additionally, two Research Initiatives in the country are directly related to Fish: the Aquatic Foods and the One Health Research Initiatives.


## Major Contributions and Reach

### GENETIC IMPROVEMENT
WorldFish has been a key player in the genetic improvement of fish varieties in Bangladesh, contributing significantly to the country's aquaculture development.

**Tilapia:**  
WorldFish introduced its Genetically Improved Farmed Tilapia (GIFT) in Bangladesh in 1994, a faster-growing and heavier variety (Hussain et al., 2000). Since then, several generations of GIFT Tilapia have been introduced, with the latest arriving in 2012 as part of the Aquaculture for Income and Nutrition (AIN) project (Keus et al., 2017). This effort has played a pivotal role in the 18-fold increase in tilapia production in Bangladesh between 2005 and 2015, largely attributed to GIFT (Tran et al., 2021). Notably, GIFT tilapia demonstrated a 64% improvement in weight gain.

**Silver Barb:**  
In 1996, WorldFish, in collaboration with BFRI-FS, developed an improved strain of Silver Barb that delivered higher yields (Khuda and Huda, 2012). After three generations of selective breeding, this strain showed a 28% improvement in growth (WorldFish, 2004).

**Carps:**  
As part of the AIN project, the Carp Genetic Improvement Program (CGIP) was launched to develop faster-growing varieties of major carp species, including rohu, catla, and silver carp. A notable achievement was the development of the G3 Rohu Carp variety, which, as of 2023, demonstrated a 37% higher weight gain compared to the unimproved riverine rohu strain. Rohu hatchlings were distributed to commercial hatcheries in 2020-2021 for broodstock development, and by 2023, over 30 hatcheries across Bangladesh were maintaining these improved broodstock.

Timeline for the Dissemination:
Phase I: Bana and AIN (FtF area only; Rohu Genetic Improvement Program research farm in Jashore)
Phase II (June 2022): On-farm trials in 19 commercial hatcheries in Jashore, Natore, and Rajshahi Districts
Phase II (October 2022): Some hatcheries in partnership with IDEA received G3 Rohu (e.g. Hai Hatchery in Dinajpur)
Phase III (Feb-Sept 2023): Project "Wider-scale promotion of Generation-3 Rohu through supply chain development" under Rehabilitation Employment and Development for the Youth (READY) in districts: Bagerhat, Gopalgonj, Narail, Satkhira, Khulna, Jashore (FtF zone)
May 9, 2023: WF handed over G3 Rohu to the Department of Fisheries (DoF)


### CROP/ AQUACULTURE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES

**Integrated Rice–Fish Culture (IRFC):**  
Integrated rice–fish culture (IRFC) is an ancient agronomic practice in Bangladesh that integrates rice farming with fish cultivation, commonly using species like rohu carp, tilapia, and giant freshwater prawn. There are two systems: concurrent farming during the rainy season (aman), where fish and rice are cultivated simultaneously in flooded plots, and rotational farming in irrigated areas.  
This practice addresses the growing demand for staples like rice and fish while optimizing scarce land and natural resources by increasing diversification, land and water productivity, and decreasing the need for pesticides since fish decrease the levels of insect larvae and aquatic weeds. It is therefore considered a sustainable intensification method that enhances diversification and productivity, even when controlling for self-selection into adoption (Islam et al., 2015). Estimates suggest that 2–3 million hectares of land in Bangladesh are suitable for IRFC. However, despite its high potential, IRFC remains marginally adopted (Ahmed et al., 2011; Nabi, 2008).

Earlier research in the 1990s and early 2000s focused primarily on the technical and biophysical aspects of adoption. In the 2000s, the Challenge Program on Water and Food expanded the focus to social, economic, and policy constraints to adoption, proposing a community-based management of floodplain fisheries. This innovation aimed to address challenges linked to common-pool resource management during the rainy season when submerged fields blur individual land boundaries. Despite an initial interest, research on collective management of IRFC has not remained a priority. Additionally, because IRFC in itself is an ancient practice, its attribution to the CGIAR remains low.

**Polyculture with Carp (Carp/Mola - SIS):**  
The Carp-Mola polyculture approach represents an innovative strategy for enhancing nutrition and income in rural Bangladesh. While carps are commonly cultivated in homestead ponds due to their high yields and market value, they offer limited nutritional benefits and are harvested less frequently (WorldFish, 2020). In contrast, small indigenous fish (SIS), such as Mola, are more nutritious and can be consumed regularly by all household members, improving overall nutrition. Despite their nutritional importance, the population of SIS is in decline due to overfishing, pollution, and the conversion of natural water bodies for irrigation, agriculture, and commercial aquaculture.  
The adoption of carp-mola polyculture could significantly boost rural households' fish production, income, and access to micronutrient-rich fish. However, SIS are often removed from ponds due to the misconception that they compete with carps, which hampers the widespread adoption of this practice. Since 2011, WorldFish has been working with poor, rural households who have idle or underutilized ponds to implement carp-mola polyculture systems. While the innovation shows great potential, it cannot be solely credited to CGIAR, as the approach was first explored in 2003 through the Mymensingh Aquaculture Extension Project (MAEP), a collaboration between the Department of Fisheries (DoF) and DANIDA (Roos, Islam, and Thilsted, 2003).

### CONSERVATION AND NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

**Rules and Regulations:**  
Hilsa, which contributes 12% to Bangladesh's fisheries production, holds significant economic and sociocultural value. From the 1970s to the 1990s, overfishing, habitat degradation, obstructed migratory routes, and the capture of juvenile fish during their reproductive period led to severe declines in Hilsa populations. However, in recent years, government efforts have led to a remarkable recovery of Hilsa populations, largely due to the Hilsa Fisheries Management Plan (2005). This plan introduced fishing bans, awareness campaigns, the establishment of sanctuaries (currently six in total), and alternative livelihoods such as cash incentives and rice distribution.  
WorldFish has played a crucial role in supporting the government's Hilsa fishery management efforts, particularly through the ECOFISH I and II projects. Before-and-after data show a marked increase in both total Hilsa production and fish size, aligning with the (Rahman et al., 2020).

**Key Recommendations and Contributions:**
- **Mesh size adjustment:** The government accepted the recommendation for an allowable mesh size of 6.5 cm for Hilsa gillnets.
- **Brood Hilsa ban:** The government extended the brood Hilsa ban from 11 to 22 days, based on WorldFish recommendations.
- **Marine Protected Area:** The creation of the Nijhum Dwip Marine Reserve was successfully advocated, with the government accepting it as a new marine protected area (MPA).
- **Hilsa sanctuary expansion:** WorldFish supported the establishment of a sixth Hilsa sanctuary, a recommendation that was also accepted.
- **Regulatory adjustments:** WorldFish contributed to fine-tuning the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock’s (MoFL) regulations for the 2019 Marine Fishing Ban, including adjusting the ban period and helping artisanal fishers adapt.
- **Hilsa Fisheries Management Action Plan (HFMAP):** WorldFish provided critical assistance in revising the HFMAP to enhance its effectiveness.
- **Marine Fisheries Act (2018):** WorldFish supported the development of the Marine Fisheries Act, a key piece of legislation for sustainable fisheries management.
- **National Fish Health Management Strategy (NFHMSB):** WorldFish also played a key role in designing the NFHMSB, aimed at improving fish health practices across the country.

**Co-Management and Livelihoods:**  
Community-based fishery management (CBM) balances fish population restoration with supporting vulnerable fishing communities. It combines a "stick" approach, training fish guards to enforce rules, with a "carrot" approach, offering food incentives and alternative income-generating activities (AIGAs) like small businesses and farming to offset conservation restrictions. Co-management groups at village, upazila, and district levels ensure coordinated efforts between local communities and authorities, fostering sustainable fishery practices while preserving livelihoods.

### VALUE CHAINS

The Livestock and Fish CRP was also particularly focused on various aspects of the aquaculture value chain, such as disease and quality controls, improved sustainability of aquaculture feed management, and the enhancement of gender equity of fish and shrimp value chains from production to consumption (CGIAR, 2014).

**Disease control:**  
Introduced Specific Pathogen-Free (SPF) shrimp seed, distributing 1 billion post-larvae free from WSSV and other viruses between 2013 and 2015, minimizing disease risks. Supported PCR testing for WSSV by increasing equipment and raising awareness among supply chain actors. Guided the implementation of the Fish Hatchery Act, streamlining recommendations for amendments to the DOF. In collaboration with the Department of Fisheries, developed a program to improve biosecurity in the tilapia industry. Also identified the MrNV virus, which causes significant losses in prawn cultures.

**Quality Control:**  
Several initiatives have improved aquaculture quality, including workshops with the Department of Fisheries to develop feed standards and a list of 605 permissible/prohibited inputs with BSFF. For seed quality, Tilapia breeding nuclei and oxygen towers for Carps were established.

**Value-chain development and Market Linkages:**  
Additionally, innovative fish by-products like boneless Hilsa and Hilsa noodles were developed for market opportunities, alongside digital tools for market linkages.
