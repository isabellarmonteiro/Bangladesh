# CGIAR Engagement in Fisheries Sector
<br>

Fisheries and Aquaculture have long been areas of significant interest for the CGIAR, with a history of many multi-center initiatives being focused on this topic. In 2003, the Challenge Program on Water and Food was launched, encompassing Aquatic Ecosystems and Fisheries as one of its main thematic areas, for which WorldFish was the leading center. This program ran for 10 years, and it aimed at improving water productivity in six river Basins, including the Indo-Gangetic one. 

The CGIAR Research Program on Aquatic Agricultural Systems (AAS) was established from 2011 to 2016, emphasizing the importance of involving local stakeholders in research activities to ensure lasting results within the "Research in Development" framework (Douthwaite et al. 2015). 
Similarly, from 2012 to 2016, these subjects were encompassed within the Livestock and Fish CGIAR Research Program (CRP), which helped give increased attention to value-chain development. In order to further prioritize research in this field, a follow-up program called Fish Agri-Food Systems (FISH) was established and operated from 2017 to 2021, being jointly led by WorldFish and the International Water Management Institute (IWMI). <br>

In Bangladesh, WorldFish serves as the primary CGIAR center dedicated to Fisheries and Aquaculture. Additionally, two Research Initiatives in the country are directly related to Fish: the Aquatic Foods and the One Health Research Initiatives. 

## Main CGIAR Priorities
### Current
In recent years, the development and dissemination of genetically improved Carp, Tilapia and Small-Indigenous Species has been at the forefront of the CGIAR's activities. Additionally, regarding Crop Management Practices, WorldFish outlines the development of Rice-Fish Systems, which allows to intensify farming systems and diversify income sources, as a priority for Bangladesh. 

When it comes to Natural Resource Management, community-based fishery management approaches have been developed to tread the fine line between restoring native populations of fish and allowing vulnerable communities to maintain their traditional sources of livelihoods. Moreover, significant attention has been placed in guaranteeing that biosecurity and seed quality standards live up to those of international markets, with important contributions in the development of disease diagnostic and control measures for tilapia and shrimp.

### Building Blocks

WorldFish's priorities for Bangladesh have evolved in conjunction with the country's conjectures. Nevertheless, a 2004 document detailing the center's achievements up to that point in time present remarkable similarities to current operational priorities. Indeed, early activities in Bangladesh included the dissemination of various rice-fish systems, the genetic enhancement of aquaculture species, and the conservation and management of both marine and inland fisheries, which hinged on characterizing the legal and insititutional constraints to conservation and on promoting the community-based management of inland waterbodies (WorldFish, 2004).  

The first multi-center initiatives drafted newly devised priorities for aquaculture in Bangladesh. Namely, the Challenge Program on Water and Food, gave further importance to developing rice-fish systems, building on longstanding community-based resource management research by WorldFish, through the newly introduced practice of community-based fish culture (Sheriff et al., 2010).

Moreover, during the first wave of CGIAR Research Programs (CRPs), new approaches to the development of fisheries and aquaculture were introduced. The Livestock and Fish CRP was particularly focused on genetic improvement of Tilapia and Carp varieties, as well as on various aspects of the aquaculture value-chain, such as disease and quality controls, improved sustainability of aquaculture feed management, and the enhancement of gender equity of fish and shrimp value chains
from production to consumption (CGIAR, 2014).

## WorldFish's Presence in Bangladesh
WorldFish has been actively engaged in Bangladesh since 1987 (WorldFish, 2004), forging strong partnerships with government entities and playing a pivotal role in policy formulation. Over the years, the center has also established an extensive network of local partners, encompassing private sector institutions, non-governmental organizations, and other local stakeholders operating at different levels. WorldFish has placed significant emphasis on enhancing the capacity of these collaborators, thus ensuring the long-term viability and sustainability of CGIAR-promoted initiatives within the country.

### Major Contributions and Reach

#### <b>Genetic Improvement</b>

In 1988, the Bangladesh Fisheries Research Institute's Freshwater Station (BFRI-FS) began to conduct research on the genetic improvement of aquaculture species. Since 1996, the breeding efforts of the BFRI-FS have been expanded in collaboration with WorldFish, under the project "Genetic
Improvement of Carp Species in Asia", developing an improved strain of Silver Barb which granted higher yields (Khuda and Huda, 2012), and an improvement in growth of 28% after three generations of selection (WorldFish, 2004). 
<br>

<b>Tilapia:</b> WorldFish introduced its Genetically Improved Farmed Tilapia (GIFT), a faster growing and heavier variety, in 1994 in Bangladesh (Hussain et al., 2000). Since then, new generations of GIFT Tilapia have been introduced frequently, with the latest one arriving to Bangladesh in 2012, in the context of the Aquaculture for Income and Nutrition (AIN) project (Keus et al., 2017). The 18-fold increase in tilapia production in Bangladesh, between the years of 2005 and 2015 has been largerly attributed to GIFT (Tran et al., 2021).
<br>

<b>Carps:</b> Under AIN, the Carp Genetic Improvement Program (CGIP) was initiated, and a fast-growing G3 Rohu Carp variety was developed.

#### <b> Crop/ Aquaculture Management Practices</b>
<b>Polyculture Systems</b>: WorldFish has promoted integrated farming practices that combine species like carps, small indigenous species (SIS), and tilapia with vegetable cultivation. These systems increase productivity, diversify income sources, and improve resource efficiency.
<br>

<b>Community-Based Fisheries</b>: Originating during CPWF, floodplain areas enclosed by dikes are collectively managed by local communities, ensuring secure access for poor fishers while enhancing seasonal fish productivity.
<br>

<b>Feed and Input Regulation</b>: Workshops with the Department of Fisheries (DoF), feed millers, and industry associations have guided feed standards. A comprehensive list of 605 permissible and prohibited aquaculture inputs was developed in collaboration with BSFF to inform policy development.

<br>

#### <b>Conservation and Natural Resource Management</b>

<br>
<b>Regulations and Policies</b>: WorldFish supported revisions to key fisheries policies, including mesh size regulations for juvenile Hilsa conservation, the extension of the brood Hilsa ban to 22 days, and the creation of new sanctuaries like the Nijhum Dwip Marine Protected Area. These measures aim to enhance sustainable fishery practices and protect biodiversity.

<b>Co-Management and Livelihoods</b>: The organization facilitated the creation of various community-level groups, such as Hilsa conservation groups and savings groups for fisherwomen, to empower local communities. Higher-level co-management committees ensure broader coordination. Food incentives and alternative income-generating activities, like seaweed farming and green mussel cultivation, help mitigate the impact of conservation measures on fishing-dependent households.

<br>

#### <b>Value Chains</b>

<b>Breeding Improvements</b>: WorldFish introduced breeding programs for SIS, Tilapia, and carps, focusing on quality broodstock, genetic improvements, and advanced hatchery techniques like oxygen tower technology. These efforts aim to ensure consistent seed quality and enhance productivity for fish farmers.

<b>Fish By-Products</b>: Innovative products like boneless Hilsa, Hilsa soup, and Hilsa noodles were developed in collaboration with Bangladesh Agricultural University. These technologies were transferred to private enterprises for large-scale commercial production, creating value-added market opportunities.


<br>

#### <b>Disease Control</b>

<b>Tilapia and Shrimp Health</b>: Tools like the Tilapia Lake Virus online platform and PCR testing for shrimp diseases like WSSV have improved early warning systems and biosecurity. Efforts to introduce Specific Pathogen-Free (SPF) shrimp seed have minimized disease risks.

<b>AMR Surveillance</b>: Training government aquaculture officers and conducting market-based sample collection have strengthened antimicrobial resistance monitoring. Collaborative research under the "One Health" framework has sought to curb the spread of resistant pathogens in aquaculture systems.
