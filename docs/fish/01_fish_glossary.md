<b>GENERAL:</b> <br> <br>
<b>Capture Fisheries</b>: catching wild aquatic organisms for subsistence or commercial purposes. <br>

<b>Aquaculture</b>: also known as fish farming or culture fisheries, it is the farming of aquatic organisms for subsistence or commercial purposes. <br>



<b>Brood stock</b>: stock of adult fish used for breeding purposes. <br>

<b>Spawning</b>: The act of depositing eggs by an aquatic animal. <br>

<b>Hatchery</b>: establishment that has stock of adult fish (broodstock), which is used to spawn fish eggs. Once the eggs hatch, they will be reared in tanks or other controlled environments in the Hatchery until they turn into fry. <br>

<b>Nursery</b>: facility where the fish fry is taken to mature. In these facilities, the fry is kept in ponds or tanks until it is old enough for transportation: when turns into fingerlings. <br>

<b>Gher Farming</b>: in Bangladesh, Gher farming refers to a "modification of  a  rice field to enable  operation of three enterprises:  prawn  (principal  enterprise),  carp,  and  MV rice" (Rahman and Barmon, 2011). A Gher has a canal in the middle, which is the only part that remains wet during the dry months, and dikes which will allow water to get trapped into its fields during the wet months, essentially making the whole Gher look like a pond. Between January and April, when only the canal is wet, farmers will plant rice in the field and irrigate it using water from the Canal. From May onwards, prawn postlarvae and carp fingerlings will be integrated in the Gher and kept until there is enough water (Rahman and Barmon, 2011).

<b>FISH:</b> <br> <br>

<b>Fry</b>: early-stages of fish development in which it has grown enough to swim and nourish itself, usually with plankton.  <br>

 <b>Fingerling</b>: the next development stage of fish, when they have approximately reached the size of a human finger. At this stage, fish has better survival rate, so it is ready to be transported and sold. <br>

<b>Small Indigenous Species (SIS)</b>: fish species that attain a maximum length of 25 cm. Because these fish are sufficiently small to be eaten whole, without removing the head or internal organs, they are very nutrient-rich.

<b>SHRIMP AND PRAWNS:</b>
<br><br>
<b>Post-larvae</b>: the first stage after passing the larval stage. This is when farmers typically acquire shrimp and prawns, which will continue their development inside ponds or tanks until they reach a marketable size. <br>
