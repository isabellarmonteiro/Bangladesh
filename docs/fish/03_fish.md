# The Fisheries Sector in Bangladesh

In Bangladesh, fish can be sourced in three main ways: through capture fisheries, which can be done in inland or marine areas, or through aquaculture, mainly in ponds, either in homesteads or as a business.

## Significance

### Economic Significance

Fisheries play a vital role in Bangladesh's agricultural operations and economy. They are not only the second most valuable type of agricultural operations (Belton et al., 2011) but also the country's most significant primary export commodity (Dey et al., 2008a). <br> 

The fisheries sector holds immense importance in rural Bangladesh as it serves as a primary source of livelihoods. Direct employment in the fisheries sector is estimated to benefit around 1.2 million individuals in the country, while fisheries-related activities indirectly support approximately 12 million people in rural areas (Dey et al., 2008a). <br> 

In recent years, there has been a major focus on promoting the growth of the aquaculture industry and the commercial fishing sector. These sectors are believed to possess untapped potential to foster rural employment, as the development of family-owned and commercial operations is expected to stimulate self-employment and the demand for hired labor. Recognizing this opportunity, the government of Bangladesh has placed considerable efforts in the promotion and support of these industries (Karim et al, 2006). 

### Nutritional and Cultural Significance

Fish is one of the most popular nutrient-rich foods in Bangladesh. Indeed, it accounts for 60% of the consumption of animal sourced products (Belton et al, 2011), and is a crucial source of vitamins and micronutrients for the poor (Thilsted et al. 1997). The common saying “rice and fish makes a Bengali” appropriately highlights the importance of aquatic organisms for diets in Bangladesh. Rural areas mostly consume low-value wild fish and cultured carps, while urban areas increasingly favor species like tilapia and higher-value wild fish produced by entrepreneurial aquaculture.

With the decrease in the consumption of pulses (Dey et al., 2008a), another protein-rich staple, the dependency on fish intensified in the early 2000s (BBS 2003c and 2007b).
Given the high reliance on fish to achieve the necessary macro and micronutrient intake, as well as the fact that its consumption is primarily sourced domestically (Dey et al., 2008), it is thus clear that the development of the fisheries sector is pivotal to guarantee Food Security in Bangladesh, amid a large increase in population that the country has experienced since the 1950s.

## Overview of the Sector

In Bangladesh, fish can be sourced in three main ways: through capture fisheries, which can be done in inland or marine areas, or through aquaculture, mainly in ponds, either in homesteads or as a business. The fisheries sector has grown significantly, with its contribution to agriculture increasing from 7% in the mid-1970s to a stable 22% between 2005 and 2021. 

While the share of GDP from agriculture has declined due to the growth of the industrial sector, the fisheries sector has continued to outperform other agricultural activities in terms of growth (Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, 2022). Fish production overall has increased, with both capture fisheries and aquaculture playing increasingly important roles. Aquaculture, in particular, has become more significant over the years, driven by challenges in wild fish populations—such as overfishing, floodplain loss, and pollution, especially in inland areas. These challenges have led to higher fish prices, making aquaculture more profitable. The development of private hatcheries and nurseries, which alleviated seed supply shortages, also contributed to this shift, although concerns about quality remain (WorldFish, 2011 - "Review of Aquaculture & Fish Consumption in Bangladesh").

> **Main Crops - Bird's eye view**>
>
> - **HILSA**: Represents 12% of fisheries production and 1% of GDP, with significant sociocultural value. Captured primarily in marine and river fishing, hilsa consumption varies by wealth, with mature hilsa consumed by wealthier groups and young hilsa by lower-income consumers. The population has declined due to overfishing, fishing of young individuals, and fishing during reproductive periods.
>
> - **SIS**: A nutrient-rich fish, particularly high in calcium and vitamin A, and consumed regularly by all household members. Traditionally found in floodplains and mainly consumed by rural, low-income households. Populations have decreased due to habitat loss from environmental degradation and competition from aquaculture and agriculture.
>
> - **CARP**: Dominates pond aquaculture, primarily in homestead and commercial ponds. Major constraints include low genetic quality of stock due to inbreeding and hybridization, which affects survival rates and adult fish weight (Sarder et al., 2014).
>
> - **TILAPIA**: Predominantly farmed in commercial ponds for domestic consumption. A majority is grown in polyculture systems. Constraints include inconsistent seed production and distribution, leading to varying fish quality (BK Barman, 2003).
>
> - **SHRIMP AND PRAWN**: Account for 5% of total fisheries production, with half farmed for export. The industry faces challenges like low productivity, quality compliance for export markets, and limited availability of high-quality seed, alongside a focus on traditional production methods that result in disease and mortality.

#### Aquaculture in the BIHS (2018-2019)
In the third wave of the BIHS, 40.2% of all households engaged in aquaculture. The following culture rates were found for species related to CGIAR work (out of the total 5605 households):

| Fish type | Share of Households (%) |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| Any | 40.2 |
| Tilapia | 9.3  |
| Rohu Carp |12.4|
| Katla Carp | 8.2|
| Silver Carp |8.1|
| Hilsa |1|
| Prawn |2.1|
| Shrimp | 0.9 |
| Mola and Other Small Fish | 15.1 |

### Constraints and Potential - by Fishery System


**Inland open water capture fisheries** face overfishing, habitat destruction, and resource depletion, exacerbated by climate change, agrochemical use, and siltation. Additional challenges include flash floods, unplanned embankments, and the deterioration of brood stock and migratory routes.

**Marine fisheries** face heavy overfishing, illegal gear use, and inadequate data on fish stocks and habitats. There are also challenges like high capital requirements, post-harvest losses, lack of marine aquaculture and breeding, by-catch issues, biodiversity loss, and marine pollution.

**Inland closed water aquaculture** faces challenges such as unpredictable seed supply, high production costs, poor feed quality, and limited species diversity. Additionally, issues like climate change, water scarcity, disease outbreaks, inbreeding, and poor investment in infrastructure and management further complicate sustainable growth.
