# Lentils

Under Construction

#### Lentils
In the past decades, one of the main genetic improvement on lentils has been to develop varieties that are both early-maturing and suitable for late-planting. Shorter-duration varieties of
non-rice crops protects yields from droughts, and allows to grow of extra crop after early harvest. Additionally, combining this characteristcs with late planting makes it possible to cultivate them in rice-fallow areas, thus achieving intensification and diversifying sources of income.
