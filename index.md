## A Deep-dive into the land of rivers

### CGIAR History in Bangladesh: A Green Revolution
Bangladesh, once facing the threat of widespread famine in the 1970s due to its rapidly growing population and limited food production, has undergone a remarkable transformation. Today, the country is self-sufficient in its food needs. Rice yields, for example, have risen from just 1 ton per hectare in the early 1970s to 3 tons per hectare by 2013 (Gautam and Faruqee, 2016). This dramatic increase in agricultural productivity is largely attributed to significant technological advancements, many of which were driven by CGIAR research.

The government’s strong focus on food security and nutrition has played a pivotal role in creating a supportive environment for Agricultural Research for Development (AR4D). This focus, combined with CGIAR's long-standing presence and close collaboration with national stakeholders, has positioned Bangladesh as a leader in the adoption and generation of evidence on agricultural innovations. CGIAR’s contributions span a wide range of areas, including varietal development, irrigation, mechanization, sustainable intensification, and market-based solutions for agricultural services. Moreover, CGIAR centers have supported the Government of Bangladesh in implementing crucial policy reforms, fostering an enabling environment for continued agricultural growth and innovation.

As a result, Bangladesh’s success story serves as a prime example of how research and development can drive agricultural progress, making it a key player in global agricultural innovation.


### Taking stock of the role of CGIAR research in Bangladesh

The Standing Panel on Impact Assessment (SPIA) works to understand and share the real-world impact of CGIAR’s research. By focusing on countries where CGIAR’s projects have achieved significant scale, SPIA aims to demonstrate how these innovations have improved lives and why continued investment in agricultural research is essential.

Currently, SPIA is conducting in-depth studies in four key countries—Ethiopia, Uganda, Vietnam, and Bangladesh—where CGIAR’s work has scaled up and made a measurable impact. These countries were chosen because their successes offer valuable insights and lessons that can guide agricultural progress around the world. The findings from SPIA’s work will help highlight the lasting benefits of CGIAR’s research, reinforcing its importance for global food security and sustainable development.
